# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Use one of these options:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): use the repository "Report a vulnerability" flow.
2. If advisories are unavailable, open a normal issue with minimal details and note that you can share full details privately.

## Scope

Security reports are most relevant for:

- Build and release scripts
- Network/API integrations (for example Dropbox sync scripts)
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Response

Best effort response and triage will be provided, but no formal SLA is guaranteed.
